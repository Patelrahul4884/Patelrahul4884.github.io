I love to work on **python** and explore new tools. I have started learning **Data science and machine learning** recently and find it pretty interesting.

I am a lifelong learner and an enthusiastic believer that great things do not come from within the comfort zone. With this intensive course, I gained new skills adapted to new daily challenges and learned new programming languages. Being passionate about technology and wanting to further develop my skills and to gain valuable experience I have decided to learn Machine Learning and started the Machine Learning course By **Andrew Ng**.
